# TheaterMuse

## 💡 Inspiration
As we all know being a playwriter aka dramatist is a tough job and there are many newcomers who are still facing imposter syndrome. These newcomers do not know where they should go. It is a tedious job to look for a reviewer and a mentor. To solve this issue our team brainstormed and came up with the idea of **TheaterMuse**. It is a one-stop destination for all the theater fans and dramatists out there.

On **TheaterMuse** users can upload their playscript and can get them reviewed by fellow users, It will help them to know where they stand and how much they need to improve. 
Sometimes it is a tough task to recruit people for your play and it is tough to get recruited as well. So we have provided an opportunity portal from where artists can get hired. There is also a shop from where users can buy things required in the theater.

## 💻 What it does

Our web app **TheaterMuse** is built with the following features:
- Shop for your theater needs.
- Users can search for all nearby theaters.
- Opportunity to get a job in the theater industry.
- User can upload their play script and get reviews from others.

## ⚙️ How we built it

- Frontend: React Js
- Database, Auth, and User Location: Appwrite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS

## ☁️ Best Use of Appwrite

For developing our backend, we are using Appwrite. We are storing the information from the user script in **Appwrite's Database**. The data about the products is also stored using **Appwrite's Storage**. We are customizing the Appwrite server's functionality by using **Appwrite's Functions**. To authenticate the users, we use **Appwrite's Authentication**. We use the **Appwrite's Position** feature to determine the user's current location and present them with the closest houses. Our backend was incredibly simple to construct with Appwrite. We discovered how strong & quick Appwrite's services are because of the free plan, which was excellent for us student hackers.
