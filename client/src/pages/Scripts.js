            The Crucible is a 1953 play by American playwright Arthur Miller. It
            is a dramatized and partially fictionalized story of the Salem witch
            trials that took place in the Massachusetts Bay Colony during
            1692â€“93. Miller wrote the play as an allegory for McCarthyism, when
            the United States government persecuted people accused of being
            communists.
